# Task-Offloading-Simulator
Simulate offloading tasks from mobile devices to nearby edge servers. Create mock mobile tasks with random CPU/memory requirements.  Simulate offloading decisions based on latency and bandwidth.  Use simple heuristics (e.g., greedy or round-robin) for resource allocation.  Edge-assisted computation to reduce mobile device load.
